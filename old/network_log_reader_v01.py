                            'Send Edges',  'Receive Edges',  'Send+Receive Edges'
            a) if the type ends in 'Errors', composite returns a single numeric with the error count.
            b) if the type ends in 'Edges', composite returns a dictionary.
            c) The edge dictionary is keyed off the other node in the connection
                and its value is the weight between those two nodes.
        3. Examples:
            composite[a]['Send Errors']
                = total number of send errors from "node a" to all other nodes.
            composite[a]['Receive Edges']

                adding edge(B, A) will overwrite edge(A, B) entry as well since direction is not important.
