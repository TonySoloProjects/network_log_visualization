## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

Notes:

1) The project was intially created in Pycharm.
2) Certain visualized routines use widgets which only work properly in a jupyter notebook
3) The project can be run in Pycharm from network_log_info.py which creates a non-interactive visualization of network errors.
4) The Pycharm files were also imported into jupyter and can be run from the file: Network_Visualizer_07.ipynb
5) Running from jupyter creates the desired fully functional interactive visualizations
